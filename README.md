# Project-one Group 3

Made on the 30th of January 2014
Team members: Caroline Jennings, Jolly Joseph, Brett Osborne, Lucas Ulbrich

In this project we explore the changes to climate and weather with climate change and its effects on wheat production, use, and export. By using a Jupyter notebook, pandas, and matplotlib, we were able to create to gather data from a wide range of sources and create graphs and visualisations to help better understand the effect climate change has on wheat production in Australia.

Firstly, we're going to see wether Australian has been impacted by climate change

Secondly, we will see if there is any relation between wheat production and climate change?

Finally, we will explore any trends in wheat usage and wheat export?
